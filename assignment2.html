            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>In this task, our objective was to analyze a 10x10 orthogonal maze and develop a sequence of instructions to guide a 5 cm x 5 cm robot from the entrance to the exit. This activity required careful observation, logical thinking, and attention to detail.

                One of the biggest challenges was translating visual paths into accurate movement commands. Since each maze cell measures 5 cm, we had to ensure that our movement instructions (in 10 cm increments) aligned with the robot’s actual physical movement. It was also important to ensure that all turns (LEFT or RIGHT 90 degrees) matched the correct orientation of the robot at each decision point.
                
                Through this activity, I improved my ability to break down complex problems into step-by-step solutions. It also reinforced how important precision is in robotics — even a small directional mistake could lead the robot into a wall or an incorrect path.
                
                If I were to repeat this task, I would consider drawing a grid over the maze and numbering the steps visually before writing the pseudocode. This would help reduce errors and make the logic easier to follow. Overall, this was a fun and educational exercise that combined spatial reasoning with algorithmic thinking.</p>
